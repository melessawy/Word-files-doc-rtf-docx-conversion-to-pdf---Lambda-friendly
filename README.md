# Word files (doc, rtf, docx) conversion to pdf using Lambda

This is a Node JS function that can be deployed as an AWS Lambda function, to convert most common Word file formats (including doc, docx and rtf) to pdf. I tested it on txt and worked fine too. It uses Libreoffice Lambda layer. I will add more details on how to appropriately deploy this function later.
